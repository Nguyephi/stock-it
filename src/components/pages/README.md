# Pages

Pages represent specific instances where templates are populated with actual content, providing context and showcasing the final interface that users interact with. They are concrete representations of what the user sees and interacts with in the application.

## Example

**HomePage**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import MainLayout from './MainLayout';
import FeaturedProducts from './FeaturedProducts';
import NewsSection from './NewsSection';

const HomePage = () => (
  <MainLayout>
    <FeaturedProducts />
    <NewsSection />
  </MainLayout>
);

export default HomePage;
```
